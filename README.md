# rg35xx-artgen

A tiny artwork generator for my personal RG35XX setup. It does not crawl any
public artwork repo, but instead relies on my own GB/GBC/GBA ROM manager
being able to export artwork; also, it can extract screenshots from 
titles.zip in MAME Extras.

The code should be reasonably self-explanatory and extendable. Maybe I'll
add screenscraper.fr API support at one point, but for now, it does exactly
what I need it to do :-)
